# ResultCode to CSV

A small application to convert ResultCode match list to CSV file which can be imported into Google Calendar. 

## Update 2016

- Match lists aren't anymore in Resultcode. This converter is kinda useless nowadays. New place for match lists is service called Taso. I'm working on Taso to CSV converter. Current version is running [here](http://metsavir.kapsi.fi/taso/#/).
